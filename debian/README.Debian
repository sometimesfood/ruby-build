ruby-build for Debian
=====================

The package dependencies/recommendations for ruby-build should be
sufficient to get you going building regular releases of MRI and REE
and most popular gems.

However, if you want to build prerelease Rubies/gems, JRuby or
Rubinius, you will have to manually install the packages listed below.

prerelease Rubies/gems
----------------------

If you want to build prerelease Rubies or gems, you might want to
install ruby-build with "--install-suggests" or install the following
packages manually:

 - autoconf
 - automake
 - bison
 - git-core
 - libtool

JRuby
-----

If you're a JRuby user, you should install a package that provides
java6-runtime-headless or java6-runtime. Any of the following should
do:

 - openjdk-6-jre-headless
 - openjdk-6-jre

Rubinius
--------

If you would like to use Rubinius, you should install these packages:
